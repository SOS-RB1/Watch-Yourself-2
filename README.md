# Watch Yourself 2 (WY2)
Simple timer (.NET, C#, WPF)

### General Information
I use a timer in my job. Concentrating on the task I hardly move for several hours. It's easy way to treat back pain, burning eyes,... In the timer, I can set a time interval after which I will be informed. Then I act.
